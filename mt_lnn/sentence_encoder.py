"""A dedicated sentence-embedding encoder for episodic recall.

PORT PROVENANCE (anti-drift anchor, recorded 2026-09-05):
    NOT a port: this module was factored out of THIS repo's
    conversation_memory in M1 28bbeb2 (2026-06-24); the recipes follow the
    BAAI bge / intfloat e5 model cards, not any Awareness source file.
    Cross-repo anchor: the Awareness-SDK embedder (github.com/everest-an/
    Awareness-SDK local/src/core/embedder.mjs, last changed d0b77f5,
    2026-04-29) ships Xenova/multilingual-e5-small — the SAME e5 family but
    a DIFFERENT integration (ONNX runtime vs torch HF here). Do NOT
    "harmonize" the two: they serve different runtimes by design.

WHY THIS EXISTS (evidence, not preference):
  The conversation/knowledge stores need a text -> key function. The obvious
  reuse is the chat model's own mean-pooled hidden state, but a diagnostic
  (_diag_conv_mem.py) showed mean-pooled Qwen2.5-0.5B CANNOT separate
  first-person paraphrases: "I love hiking" always loses to "marine biologist"
  (the anisotropic universal nearest neighbour), best 2/3 across every pooling
  + centering variant. A small purpose-built sentence model gets it right, so
  for recall QUALITY we use a real embedder, not the LM's hidden state.

WHY MULTILINGUAL (intfloat/multilingual-e5-small, ~118M, the default):
  This project is bilingual -- the companion is spoken to in Chinese AND English.
  An English-only encoder (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) recalls English well but
  mis-handles Chinese: it could not reliably recall Chinese queries and typed
  Chinese statements at only 4/5. multilingual-e5-small recalls 5/5 including
  Chinese queries and types 10/11 (_diag_e5_multilingual.py vs _diag_bge.py),
  because its embedding space is shared across languages. e5 is the family
  Awareness-Market uses for the same reason. bge is still selectable (English-
  only deploys) -- the per-model recipe below adapts pooling + prefixes.

HONEST SCOPE: this only makes RETRIEVAL good ("好用"); it adds no understanding,
reasoning, or emotion. It is the right tool for "remember what the user said",
nothing more.

The model is loaded lazily on first encode and cached, so importing this module
is cheap and a server that never enables conversation memory pays nothing. Each
model family has its own recipe: bge uses CLS pooling and prefixes only the
query; e5 uses masked-mean pooling and prefixes BOTH sides ("query: "/"passage:
"). Asymmetric prefixing (is_query=True/False) widens the relevant/off-topic gap.

    pooling / query_instruction / passage_instruction:
        Explicit overrides for the inferred recipe (None -> use the inferred
        value). Set query/passage to "" for symmetric, prefix-free embedding.
