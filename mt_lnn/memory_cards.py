"""Typed personal memory cards for conversational recall.

PORT PROVENANCE (anti-drift anchor, recorded 2026-09-05):
    upstream:       https://github.com/everest-an/Awareness-Market
                    typed knowledge cards + query-type-router
                    (src/core/query-type-router.mjs, cardTypeBoost)
    ported:         2026-06-24 (this file's birth commit: M1 e0f28e2)
    upstream state: query-type-router.mjs last changed at 5fc2472 (2026-04-18);
                    repo HEAD at port time 862df47 (2026-05-05)
    drift rule: neither repo bumps the other — if the upstream router or
    taxonomy changes materially, re-diff against this port BY HAND.

DESIGN BORROWED FROM (and credited to) the Awareness-Market project
(github.com/everest-an/Awareness-Market): knowledge is stored as TYPED cards
(category + confidence), and retrieval is biased by classifying the query and
boosting cards of the matching type (its query-type-router / cardTypeBoost).
Awareness-Market uses a 7-category PERSONAL taxonomy
  personal_preference / important_detail / plan_intention /
  activity_preference / health_info / career_info / custom_misc
and a multilingual-e5 embedder for zero-keyword, language-agnostic routing.

ADAPTED TO OUR CASE (a small "Her-like" companion on a 0.5B edge stack):
  - Reuse OUR shared SentenceEncoder (mt_lnn.sentence_encoder), which defaults to
    multilingual-e5-small -- the SAME embedder family Awareness-Market uses -- so
    there is ONE encoder for both recall and typing, and Chinese statements route
    to the same type as their English equivalents (verified 4/4 Chinese in
    _diag_memory_cards.py; an English-only encoder mis-typed them).
  - A companion taxonomy with an explicit EMOTION type (the feature ask), since
    "remembering how you felt" is central to a Her-like experience and was not a
    first-class category upstream.
  - Classification is pure embedding nearest-neighbour to per-type ANCHOR
    phrasings (no hard-coded keywords -> language-agnostic via the shared space).
    Below a confidence floor a statement falls back to the catch-all `detail`
    type rather than being mis-typed.

HONEST SCOPE: this is a lightweight semantic TAGGER, not affect/intent
understanding. Calling a sentence `emotion` means "it embeds near emotional
self-disclosure phrasings", NOT that the system feels or comprehends emotion.
It improves which past statement is recalled and lets the assistant know a memory
is emotional -- useful, bounded, and not a claim of sentience.

# Card taxonomy. Each type carries STATEMENT anchors (how a user phrases such a
# fact about themselves) and QUERY anchors (how a later turn asks for it). Both

# embedding cluster -> better routing (the Awareness-Market archetype recipe).
